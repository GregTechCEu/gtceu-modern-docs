# Updating from `1.0.x` to `1.1.0`


## Circuit Item Tags

Item tags for circuits have been changed from `#forge:circuits/<tier>` to `#gtceu:circuits/<tier>`.  
You will need to update any recipes accordingly.


## Recipe ID Changes

Several recipe IDs have changed. If you are removing/modifying any recipes by ID, please check if they are still valid.


## Ore Stone Types

Due to changes in how ores are rendered, ore stone types will now additionally require a base model location:

```js
e.create('my_ore', 'ore')
    .baseModelLocation('some_other_mod:block/my_block')
    //...
```
