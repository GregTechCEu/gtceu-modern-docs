# Ore Generation

GregTech has its own ore generation that is quite different from that of Minecraft's standard system.
Due to technical limitations, this system does not use Minecraft's features and works a bit differently.

GT's ores generate in large veins that are placed along a grid (and a random offset per vein) throughout the world.

In this section, you will learn how to customize ore generation for your modpack.
