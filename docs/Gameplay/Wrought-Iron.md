# Wrought Iron

Wrought Iron is needed to craft machines starting at High Pressure Steam. It can be obtained by molding Iron Nuggets in an Alloy Smelter, smelting the Iron Nuggets in a Furnace into Wrought Iron Nuggets and then molding the Wrought Iron Nuggets into ingots in an Alloy Smelter for further processing, e.g. making Wrought Iron Plates.
