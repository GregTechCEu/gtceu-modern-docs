Welcome to GTCEu Modern, a port of GTCEu 1.12.2 for more modern versions. GregTEch completly overhauls the default minecraft experience, use machines and Materials to progess through the ages.
If this is your first time playing Gregtech, we highly suggest the [GTCEu Community Pack](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/modpacks/gregtech-community-pack)
