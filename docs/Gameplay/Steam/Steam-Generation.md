Title: Generating Steam

# Generating Steam

## Early game

For early game steam generation you have two options:

### Boilers
 * Liquid - allowing you to use hot liquids like lava. To heat up water and get steam.
 * Solid - uses coal to heat up the water.
### Solar Boilers
 * generate steam from solar boilers _doesn't work at night_.

For water you can use a **primitive pump**

or use a water connection from any other mod.

## After Steel

After unlocking steel (using a primitive blast furnace) you will get access to the high pressure versions of the boilers and allow you to produce more steam.

## Large Boilers 

Large boilers allow you to create massive amount of steam in the blink of an eye. A boiler can be constructed of many different GT materials, that will allow for different steam generation rates (_consult the table below_).

## Base Generation Rates 

### Single Block

| Boiler type | Low pressure | High pressure |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| Solar       | 6 L/T        | 18 L/T        |
| Liquid      | 12 L/T       | 30 L/T        |
| Solid       | 6 L/T        | 15 L/T        |

### Multiblock 

| Boiler        | Generation | Boil up | Max temp |
| ------------- | ---------- | ------- | -------- |
| Bronze        | 800 L/T    | 40s     | 1074K    |
| Steel         | 1800 L/T   | 90s     | 2074K    |
| Titanium      | 3200 L/T   | 160s    | 3474K    |
| Tungstensteel | 6400 L/T   | 160s    | 6674K    |
