Title: Generating Steam

# Generating Steam

## Early game

For early game steam generation you have Three options:

 * Liquid - allowing you to use hot liquids like lava. To heat up water and get steam.
 * Solid - uses coal to heat up the water.
 * Solar - generate steam from solar boilers _doesn't work at night_.


## Water
For water you can use a **primitive pump**, it generates water _anywhere_ in the world!

or use a water connection from any other mod, be carefull to set the flow _or the little arrow pointing in the direction you want_, or else all your water pipes will fill with steam!

## Steel
Before you get started on the quest for steel, you'll need a few coke ovens _you should have made these before steam_. you need 116 coke oven bricks to form 1 coke oven. You'll need this for _charcoal_, or _Coke_. Coke is the most effeciant way of making steel in a primitive blast furnace. Instead of needing 2 coal for 1 steel, with coke you can use 1 coke for 1 steel. _Using Wrought iron isnt worth it for steel just yet_.


This is a perfect time to learn about _wall sharing_, probably the **most** usefull feature for multiblocks, it is a feature which allows you to share the walls of a multiblock of the same type, so instead of making 58 coke bricks, you only need _49_ bricks with wall sharing, some multiblocks like Large Chemical Reactor _or LCR_, can walshare on _5_ sides, but multiblocks like Electric Blast Furnace _or EBF_ can only share _4_ sides.

Now that you have steam machines, you will need a compresser to craft fireclay Bricks. From brick dust and clay dust, Craft fireclay dust. At a ratio of 1:1:2

Put it into the compresser and wait 3-5 buisness days. Once you have compressed fireclay bricks just smelt them and ta-da, you'll need a lot more. You will need these bricks to craft the Primitave Blast Furnace

|    Fuel     |    Ingot     | Time |
|-------------|--------------|------|
| 2x Charcoal |     Iron     | 90 s |
| 2x Coal     |     Iron     | 90 s |
| 1x Coke     |     Iron     | 75 s |
| 2x Charcoal | Wrought Iron | 40 s |
| 2x Coal     | Wrougth Iron | 40 s |
| 1x Coke     | Wrought Iron | 35 s |

_you can also use blocks just multiply every thing by 9_

## After Steel

After unlocking steel you will get access to the high pressure versions of the boilers and allow you to produce more steam and unlock the full potential of the steam Machines, high pressure machines arn't mandatory, but are nice to have. You can also now start the **LV age**.

## Large Boilers 

Large boilers allow you to create massive amount of steam in the blink of an eye. A boiler can be constructed of many different GT materials, that will allow for different steam generation rates (_consult the table below_). It isn't worth making these as they are expensive and steam isn't a good fuel for MV and above.

## Base Generation Rates 

### Single Block

| Boiler type | Low pressure | High pressure |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------- |
| Solar       | 6 L/T        | 18 L/T        |
| Liquid      | 12 L/T       | 30 L/T        |
| Solid       | 6 L/T        | 15 L/T        |

### Multiblock 

| Boiler        | Generation | Heat up | Max temp | Age |
| ------------- | ---------- | ------- | -------- |-----|
| Bronze        | 800 L/T    | 40s     | 1074K    | LV  |
| Steel         | 1800 L/T   | 90s     | 2074K    | MV  |
| Titanium      | 3200 L/T   | 160s    | 3474K    | EV  |
| Tungstensteel | 6400 L/T   | 160s    | 6674K    | IV  |

*L/T -> Liters per tick (1L = 1mB)
