# Developing GTCEu Modern

If you want to contribute to the development of GTCEu Modern, please feel free to submit a 
pull request with your changes.

The following pages describe a few important concepts that you will likely run into when working with our codebase.

This mod is based on [Architectury](https://docs.architectury.dev/start) for compatibility across multiple modding
platforms, as well as the [LDLib](https://github.com/Low-Drag-MC/LDLib-Architectury/wiki) library for a lot of
commonly used functionalities. Please refer to the documentation for those as well.
