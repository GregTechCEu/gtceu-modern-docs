# LDLib's SyncData System

For serializing and synchronizing fields, LDLib's annotation-based SyncData system is used.  
Using this system, almost all boilerplate code regarding these topics can be omitted.

For more info on the SyncData annotations, please refer to the following chapters, as well as to the
[LDLib Wiki](https://github.com/Low-Drag-MC/LDLib-Architectury/wiki/SyncData-Annotations).
