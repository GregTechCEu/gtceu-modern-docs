# How To Use SyncData Annotations

For serializing and synchronizing fields, LDLib's annotation-based 
[SyncData system](https://github.com/Low-Drag-MC/LDLib-Architectury/wiki/SyncData-Annotations) is used.  
Using this system, almost all boilerplate code regarding these topics can be omitted.

For more info on the SyncData annotations, please refer to the following chapters, as well as to the
[LDLib Wiki](https://github.com/Low-Drag-MC/LDLib-Architectury/wiki/SyncData-Annotations).
